# Sales-Time-Series-Forecasting
The Online Retail Forecasting Project is designed to use the power of data analytics to enhance the operational efficiency and strategic planning of online retail businesses in the UK. By analyzing patterns, trends, and seasonal variations in past transactions and weather data, we aim to **predict future daily sales in the UK**. This involves a deep dive into past transactions to identify patterns, trends, and seasonal fluctuations that significantly affect sales outcomes.

In this context, the project will employ a range of advanced predictive modelling techniques, **including both statistical and machine learning models**. The objective is to develop robust forecasting models that can reliably anticipate daily sales figures. These models are expected to serve as critical tools for inventory managers, enabling them to optimize stock levels based on predicted sales volumes, thus reducing the cost of overstocking and minimizing the risk of stockouts. In addition, integrating weather data acknowledges the significant impact of weather conditions on consumer online buying patterns, enabling a more contextually relevant forecast.
